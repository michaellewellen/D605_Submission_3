This repository will hold the data that outlines the project details including Amazon Air Optimization Solution.DOCX and Amazon Distribution.DOCX provided by WGU for this assignment.  It will also contain the Jupyter notebook created in association with this project. Should any other artifacts be created in the process of solving this problem (cleaned data, graphs etc) they will also be included.  Finally a log file of all the commit history associated with this project. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Linear Programming to find an optimal distribution of transportation routes to minimize the cost for Amazon in our limited scope problem.
